# Elena Joy Photography site

This is a website that was built during a Udemy Course I was following along to. The main things I was learning from this was the use of flex and all of the details
that are involved with it. Such as displaying flex, flex directions, and dealing with flex box. The last thing that was discussed was CSS grid.

This will help me in my future projects that I do that involve using these parts of CSS.

Here is the link to the site
